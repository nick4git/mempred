	Both OPM and PDBTM files are now parsed and represented as dictionary (very similar to Map in Java).
	The format of the dictionary is SEQUENCE_NAME -> (SEQUENCE, SECONDARY_STRUCTURE_PREDICTION)

	TODO -- Quirin

	DO FOLLOWING STATS:

	- number of sequence in each of the databases
	- length statistics: MEAN, MEDIAN, STANDARD DEVIATION
	- histogram of length distribution and save it:
		read http://matplotlib.org/1.2.1/examples/pylab_examples/histogram_demo.html to learn how to plot histogram in python
	- how many occurrences of each species:
		PDB species can be seen by the name. For example, following sequence
		>G1UBD1|3rgbI|PMOB_METCA 0.97
		belongs to the species METCA. Use function some_string.split() to split a given list

	If done, upload the statistics and histogram plot onto group wiki page: https://i12r-studfilesrv.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/pp12016bio/index.php/Group_2
